# OBS_TallyLight

This fork is a modification of td0g's original project.  I've added the ability for mangement of two LEDs (Program and Preview) at each camera, and for the Raspberry Pi to "read" the camera# (1-8) from the GPIO inputs (3bits).

See the PDF for hardware schematic.

Updated Nov25 for latest Raspberry Pi OS (Trixie) and changing from "obswebsocket" to "obsws_python" to support the latest OBS Web Sockets API.
